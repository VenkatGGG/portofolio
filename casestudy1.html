          <p>
            As an entrepreneur with a keen interest in urban mobility, my
            journey with Flit Taxi began with a question: How can we better
            connect our cities and their people?? Of course.. Economically. This
            venture grew from the collective insights of a community passionate
            about redefining transportation. Their needs and feedback shaped the
            vision of a dual-service app that simplifies urban travel and
            delivery - Flit Taxi.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            The shi rom concept to execution was catalyzed by the desire to not
            only bridge gaps in the market but also to support the drivers who
            are the backbone of urban mobility. In recognizing their struggles
            with commission-based models, we saw an opportunity to innovate.
            Flit Taxi was designed as a commission-free platform, placing the
            well-being of drivers at its core, which in turn offers better
            services to users.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project is a reflection of my commitment to social and economic
            sustainability in urban transport. With each feature, Flit Taxi
            encapsulates my vision of fostering a more connected and equitable
            city life. It is a testament to the power of community-driven
            innovation, aiming to transform the urban commute into a more
            enjoyable and fair experience for all.

          <p class="text3">
            There's a distinct need for an all-encompassing transportation app
            that not only simplifies commutes and deliveries but also empowers
            drivers with a zero-commission model, enhancing their earnings and
            commitment to providing superior service.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Urban residents and small businesses struggle to find a singular,
            efficient platform for their varied transportation needs. The
            current market's separation of ride-hailing and delivery services
            leads to a disjointed and often frustrating user experience.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Drivers, the linchpins of the ride-hailing and delivery ecosystem,
            contend with platforms that diminish their earnings through
            substantial commissions. This outdated model contributes to driver
            dissatisfaction and instability within the urban transport sector.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The existing applications lack a driver-centric approach, failing to
            provide a sustainable and equitable working model. This oversight
            results in a disconnect between driver welfare and service quality
            offered to users.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            A unified app that offers a commission-free model for drivers and
            combines user-friendly ride-hailing and delivery services is
            conspicuously absent, highlighting a need for innovation in the
            urban mobility space.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            This proposed problem statement for Flit Taxi underscores the
            necessity for an integrated transportation solution and emphasizes
            the importance of a commission-free model for drivers, aligning with
            the broader mission of improving urban transportation for all
            stakeholders involved.

                Uber revolutionized ride-hailing with its vast network and smart
                algorithms, offering fast services and dynamic pricing. While
                its app design prioritizes user experience with real-time
                tracking and easy payments, it has been critiqued for surge
                pricing and driver relations. The platform's design is highly
                intuitive, offering real-time tracking and seamless payment
                options, which set a high standard for competitors in the
                market.

                interface is accessible, though service consistency and driver
                support are areas for improvement. Ola continues to evolve
                amidst the dynamic regulatory landscape of transport apps. Yet,
                Ola's competitive edge is occasionally overshadowed by
                challenges in consistency of service quality and driver welfare
                concerns.

          Venturing out to local auto rickshaw stands, I sought first-hand
          insights from the drivers themselves. Engaging in face-to-face
          conversations allowed me to validate our hypotheses with direct,

          integral to crafting a user-centric design that addressed the actual
          needs of drivers and passengers alike.

              Prior to conducting our survey, I carefully formulated questions
              to delve into the nuances of user and driver experiences with
              transportation apps. The survey, reaching out to a diverse group
              of users and drivers, was meticulously designed to gauge the
              relevance and applicability of our services. From the user
              perspective, there was a pronounced call for more affordable
              fares, while drivers expressed a strong preference for a
              no-commission model that would enhance their earnings without
              corporate deductions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The feedback illuminated a keen awareness among users about the
              financial strain of travel costs and a unanimous appeal from
              drivers for a fairer economic model. Despite the robust
              interaction within our digital forums, the need for an integrated
              mobile application was evident, signaling a significant market gap
              Flit Taxi could fill. This dual-sided insight served as a
              compelling indicator of the potential for Flit Taxi to achieve
              high user adoption, driven by the community's desire for
              affordability and driver profitability.

              In laying the groundwork for wireframing, I immersed myself in the
              environment of our users — frequenting bustling city centers,
              popular ride-sharing spots, and online driver forums.

              Interacting with drivers and passengers alike, I cultivated a
              meaningful dialogue that unveiled their daily routines, pain
              points, and what they valued most in their transit experiences.
              This sincere engagement granted me a vivid understanding of their
              world, which I translated into authentic user personas for Flit
              Taxi. These personas guided the formation of task flows and user
              journeys that resonated with real-life scenarios, providing a
              strong, user-informed basis for the app's design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this process, I uncovered the underlying patterns and

              In the exploration and ideation phase for Flit Taxi, my focus was
              on the essential functions that would meet our user personas'
              needs — effortless ride booking, transparent fare estimation, and
              driver-rider communication.

              managing her driving schedule, and Raj coordinating his business
              deliveries. Vital features envisioned included a real-time ride
              tracker, an earnings dashboard for drivers, and an in-app chat for

          In the ideation phase for Flit Taxi, I homed in on pivotal features
          that our personas indicated were essential—effortless ride-booking,
          transparent fare structures, and a robust driver-partner interface.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p class="t4">
          I laid out the user journey for both riders booking their trips and
          drivers managing their rides. Central to the app's design was a
          dashboard that provided real-time earnings for drivers and ride status
          updates for riders. A comprehensive fare calculator and a
          communication hub for driver-rider interactions were also sketched
          out.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p class="t4">
          From there, I progressed to wireframing, taking special care to
          streamline the navigation and ride management process. Our wireframes
          evolved into mid- fidelity prototypes, integrating user feedback to
          refine a system that felt personalized and straightforward,
          facilitating a stress-free commute and delivery experience. These
          prototypes served as a blueprint, illustrating the app's workflow with
          clear interaction points.

              I created an interactive prototype and conducted an initial test
              with a small group of potential users. The test was structured to
              provide insights into the user experience and the app's
              intuitiveness.

            <br>
            <p class="t6">
               <b>Task 1 :</b> Navigate through the app to book a ride and assess the

              communicate the urgency of the situation.

              Following the usability testing phase for Flit Taxi, I employed
              affinity mapping to systematically sort and interpret the user
              feedback. Utilizing Nielsen's Severity Rating Scale, I
              distinguished and prioritized the most pressing issues that
              required immediate attention in the design iteration process.

              To hone in on the visual appeal of the app, I conducted a

              components, with a special focus on the layout and color schemes.
              These insights were crucial in evolving the app's interface,
              confirming that the chosen design elements aligned well with our
              users' preferences, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.
